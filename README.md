# RTSP
c++ RTSP Client/Server - win32/linux/android

this project is RTSP client/server library for windows/linux/android.

under 'test' folder there are test examples.

parts of this project's source code are from open source streaming library live555.

as many developer knows live555 source code is terribly complicated. 

so i decided to simplify it and make cross-platform library.
